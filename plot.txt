PLOT

You are a soldier who has just finished the war in the desert. 
Your village was torched and razed to the ground and your wife was beheaded. 
Your children also were taken as slaves to work in the mines. Your people have lost the war, 
but 20 of you only did survive. Your people have decided to roam the desert in search 
of a village but thirst, hunger and heat will kill you, except 2 or 3. 
You have divided, and you are the one to come to this village.
.............................................................................
Do you find yourself in a decaying house that you bought with the stolen money 
in the war. A guy comes in and yells at you: "Quit moving! Caliph 's talking about, 
and you only are missing! " 
You go out and you find yourself in a crowd of people around a wooden platform 
where the Caliph is talking to the crowd. The caliph announces that taxes 
were raised again. It starts a mess with the crowd. 
So the caliph cries If you do not pay, you all will die! 
Then goes to his palace. The crowd dissolves, the guy shows up and tells 
you how things are going in that village (very bad). 
He asks you if you have  a job, and you have to choose between NO and NO  So you choose NO. 
Then he takes you in his bakery where he tells you that they stole all his meat and bread. 
So he gives you the task of going into the desert to hunt 6 wild boars to settle the bill. 
Once caught, you take the boars and he pays you a sum of 500 coins
